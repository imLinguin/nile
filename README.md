# Nile
Linux native Amazon Games client, based on [this research](https://github.com/Lariaa/GameLauncherResearch/wiki/Amazon-Games)

Nile aims to be CLI and GUI tool for managing and playing games from Amazon. 

## Features
- Login to Amazon Account
- Download games
- Play games (with Wine/Proton on Linux)
- Play games using [Bottles](https://usebottles.com) (`--bottle` parameter)

## Might not work
- Online games, that use `FuelPump` (I don't have any game like that to test)

# Purpose
This is my attempt to make Amazon Games useful for Linux users, who want to play titles obtained thanks to [Prime](https://prime.amazon.com) membership.

# Dependencies
## Arch and derivatives (Manjaro, Garuda, EndeavourOS)
`sudo pacman -S python-pycryptodome python-zstandard python-requests python-protobuf python-json5`
## Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu, Pop!_OS)
`sudo apt install python3-pycryptodome python3-requests python3-zstandard python3-protobuf python3-json5`

## With pip
> Do this after cloning the repo and cd into the directory
> Do not install if you installed dependencies through your package manager  

This is **NOT** recommended as it can potentially collide with distribution packages [source](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/)  
new versions of `pip` will prevent you from doing it outside of virtual environment

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Building PyInstaller executable

If you wish to test nile in Heroic flatpak you likely need to build the `nile` executable using pyinstaller

- Get pyinstaller

```
pip install pyinstaller
```

- Build the binary (assuming you are in the nile directory)

```
pyinstaller --onefile --name nile nile/cli.py
```

# Contributing

I'm always open for contributors

black is used for code formatting

## Setting up dev environment:
- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/imLinguin/nile`
- CD into the directory `cd nile`
- Setup virtual environment `python3 -m venv env`
- Install [dependencies](#dependencies)
- Run nile `./bin/nile`


# Prior work

This is based on Rodney's work here: https://github.com/derrod/twl.py
Some of his code is implemented in nile, since nothing changed since then in terms of downloading and patching
